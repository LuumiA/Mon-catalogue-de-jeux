# README for Assets

This directory contains assets used in the video game website project. 

## Resources

- Images: Store any images related to the games or the website here.
- Icons: Include any icons used for buttons or navigation.

## Usage

Make sure to reference these assets correctly in your HTML and CSS files to ensure they display properly on the website. 

For example, if you have an image named `game-icon.png`, you can use it in your HTML like this:

```html
<img src="assets/game-icon.png" alt="Game Icon">
```

Keep this directory organized to easily manage your assets as the project grows.
